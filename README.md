# Tymer

A dead-simple CLI timer, written in python.
The purpose of which is not to create yet another timer program, but rather as a little project to get back into programming.

## Features I want this to have

- [ ] Shell completion
- [ ] Configuration file with named timers
- [ ] Send notification when timer runs out
